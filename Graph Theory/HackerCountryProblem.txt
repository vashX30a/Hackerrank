There are N cities in Hacker Country. Each pair of cities are directly connected by a unique directed road, and each road has its own toll that must be paid every time it is used. You're planning a road trip in Hacker Country, and its itinerary must satisfy the following conditions:

You can start in any city.
You must use 2 or more different roads (meaning you will visit 2 or more cities).
At the end of your trip, you should be back in your city of origin.
The average cost (sum of tolls paid per road traveled) should be minimum.
Can you calculate the minimum average cost of a trip in Hacker Country?

Time Limits 
Time limits for this challenge are provided here.

Input Format

The first line is an integer,  (number of cities). 
The N subsequent lines of N space-separated integers each describe the respective tolls or traveling from city i to city j; in other words, the j-th integer of the i-th line denotes the toll for traveling from city i to city j.

Note: As there are no roads connecting a city to itself, the i-th integer of line i will always be .

Constraints 

1 < N <= 500
0 < toll_cost <= 200
roads_travelled >= 2

 

Output Format

Print the minimum cost as a rational number p/q (tolls paid over roads traveled). The greatest common divisor of p and q should be 1.

Sample Input

2
0 1
2 0

Sample Output

3/2
Explanation

The toll from city C0 to city C1 is 1. The toll from c1 to c0 is 2. Your travel cost p = 1 + 2 = 3 . Your number of roads traveled is q = 2. Thus, we print 3/2 as our answer.
